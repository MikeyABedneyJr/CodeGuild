# PDX Code Guild Exercises
Here will rest the files created while I am in the 16-week immersive Code Guild Evening Bootcamp that ended May 18th, 2015.
A project of particular note is the teacher escape game.  This text-based game created as the first python project during the bootcamp.  The player assumes the role of a teacher who must overcome a variety of challenges to escape the building on a Friday.  Failure to succeed will result in sleeping under a desk until classes resume on Monday.
